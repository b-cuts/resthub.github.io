## Spring Stack

* Fix BoneCP version and configuration
* Upgrade slf4j, logback, jackson, model mapper, async http client, hibernate, hibernate validator,
ehcache, spring data, jetty and fest assert dependencies

## Backbone Stack

Following libraries updated and may lead to some minor incompatibility, most significant ones are detailed bellow :

 * Backbone 0.9.10 to 1.0 ([Upgrade guide](http://backbonejs.org/#upgrading))
  * Renamed Collection's "update" to set, for parallelism with the similar `model.set()`, and contrast with `reset`.
    It's now the default updating mechanism after a fetch. If you'd like to continue using "reset",
    pass `{reset: true}`.
  * Your route handlers will now receive their URL parameters pre-decoded.
 * Backbone relational 0.7.1 to 0.8.5 ([Detailed changelog](http://backbonerelational.org/#change-log))
  * Supports Backbone 1.0.0
  * Implemented the add, merge and remove options on `Collection.add` when working with RelationalModels.
    This also works when using set to change the key on nested relations.
 * RequireJS 2.1.4 to 2.1.5
 * Update to latest async.js
 * Handlebars 1.0 beta6 to 1.0 rc3
 * Update to latest keymaster.js
 * Underscore.String from 2.0.0 to 2.3.0
  * Underscore.String is exported as `_s`, not `_.str` anymore
