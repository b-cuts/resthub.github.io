I am happy to announce that **RESThub website has been completely revamped** (skin & contents) for a
better experience ...

* We moved from a sphinx and RST based two pages (one for each stack) site to a markdown
  based **more sophisticated [documentation](/docs/) structure with well organised sections**.
* We added a **nice search functionality** based on the great [swiftype](https://swiftype.com/) engine.
* All styles were redesigned to make **documentation easier to read** : contrasts, emphasizes,
  code sections, ...
* Site is now **fully responsive** and should allow to discover RESThub on tablets and smartphones.
* We now have a **["News" section](/news/)** to share releases and thoughts.

We also have a new **twitter account** to share with you:

<div class="text-center">
<a href="https://twitter.com/resthubproject" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false" data-size="large">Follow @resthubproject</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=RESThub" class="twitter-hashtag-button" data-related="resthub" data-size="large">Tweet #RESThub</a>
</div>

We hope that you will like it. Don't hesitate to give us feedback or open a ticket
here if you encounter any issue: <https://github.com/resthub/resthub.github.io/issues>.

This website was made with [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [boostrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) and is now hosted on
[github-pages](http://pages.github.com/).
